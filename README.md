##Car Seat Adjustment Simulator
#Project Overview
The Car Seat Adjustment Simulator is a Python-based program that helps users calculate optimal car seat adjustments based on their height, leg length, arm length, and driving preference. The program calculates essential adjustments like seat distance, backrest angle, steering wheel position, and headrest height to ensure an ergonomic and comfortable driving experience.

##How It Works
Users provide their height, leg length, arm length, and driving preference (either "sporty" or "relaxed"). The program uses these inputs to calculate seat adjustments based on ergonomic formulas. Once the calculations are made, the program displays the recommended seat settings in an easy-to-read format.

#Features
Interactive and simple text-based interface.
Calculates seat adjustments for different body types and preferences.
Provides ergonomic recommendations for a comfortable driving position.
No external libraries required, making it easy to run in any Python environment.
Technologies Used
Python (no external dependencies).

Sample Output
Here’s an example of the program’s output:

Welcome to the Car Seat Adjustment Simulator!  
Enter your height (cm): 170  
Enter your leg length (cm): 85  
Enter your arm length (cm): 75  
Enter your driving preference (sporty/relaxed): sporty  

#Recommended Adjustments:  
Seat Distance: 34.00 cm  
Backrest Angle: 90°  
Steering Wheel Position: 45.00 cm  
Headrest Height: 136.00 cm  
Customization
You can easily modify the calculation rules in the calculate_adjustments function to accommodate different ergonomic standards or personal preferences. This flexibility allows for further improvements or adjustments based on your needs.
